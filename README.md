# About the Project
This research introduces an adaptive deep learning approach aimed at enhancing text-based cyber threat detection. The system utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, enriched with embedding and dropout layers, to analyze textual data and classify it into distinct categories of cyber threats. The model's architecture allows it to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between benign content and eight threat categories, offering realtime insights into cyber threat intelligence. The ability of the system to process and categorize complex textual data makes it an effective tool for proactive cyber defense.
